# Latent Class Analysis of Substance Use Disorder Risks

## Project Overview
This project uses Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to identify distinct subgroups of individuals based on their risk factors for Substance Use Disorder (SUD). The analysis is based on the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) 2015-2019 dataset. Following the LCA, predictive models (XGBoost, Random Forest) are built for each class to identify the most significant predictors of SUD within each subgroup.
