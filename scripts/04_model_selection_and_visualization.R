# --- PRE-REQUISITES ---
# This script assumes you have:
# 1. The 'cleaned_factored_data.rds' file from Step 1.
# 2. The saved 4-class model at "all_lca_models/lca_model_4_classes.rds".
# 3. The original "NSDUH_2015-2019.csv" file.

# --- 1. LOAD LIBRARIES ---
# You may need to install gtsummary: install.packages("gtsummary")
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(poLCA)
library(gtsummary)
library(gt) # Added for creating beautiful tables

# --- NEW: Check for and install the 'cardx' package if it's missing ---
# This prevents the script from pausing with an interactive installation prompt.
